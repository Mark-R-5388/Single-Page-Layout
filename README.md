# Single-Page-Layout
A simple single page layout.  Working on CSS and HTML basics
My biggest problem right now is with layout and design properties with CSS.
For this layout i worked on:
  1. setting the margins to be full screen
    *next step is making the view responsive to different zoom levels and device screen widths.
  2. Centering images within my project.
    *ill be working on using grid next to develop a better looking flow to my projects
  3. Creating a navigation bar with working links to the site.
